1. Data loading and preprocessing
* Input size = (224,224)
* Normalization: Used the conventional way of diving image with 255
* No other transformations are applied
2.  Model definition and initialization
* Unet architecture
* Input size = (batch_size,1,224,224)
* Outputs size = (batch_size, 1, 224, 224) (both outputs are of same size)
3. Training, validation and experimentation
* Loss function used: dice loss
* Metrics used : iou
* hyperparameters tuned: Played around little bit with learning rate and tuned it. Rest of the parameters seemed fine.
