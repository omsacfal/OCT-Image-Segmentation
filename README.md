# OCT-Image-Segmentation
Geographic atrophy is a major vision-threatening manifestation of age-related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of blindness globally.Geographic atrophy has no proven treatment or method for easy detection. Rapid, reliable, and objective detection and quantification of geographic atrophy from optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal scans is necessary for disease monitoring, prognostic research, and to serve as clinical endpoints for therapy development

This project uses U-Net Segmentation technique for segmenating IRF and SRF fluids from OCT images
